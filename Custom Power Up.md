The focus of this section is document some of features incorporated intot the custom power up node.js app and not on the construction of such an app. Trello support for building Power Up is available [here}(https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/power-ups/your-first-power-up/)

The capabilities support by the client.js on the app included :
- Authorization status
- Show authorization
- Show settings
  - this allows the admin to set the url for the webapp to provide the UI in the attachment sections
  - this is maintained at board level as a shared setting
- Card buttons
  - this is to activate the UI for the application (in the case it will be "Share a card")
- Attachment sections
  - The UI will appear as inside the attachment sections and it can be removed and reactivate using the card button

Presently, the custom power is accessible to all users.
